[This](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3196984) is a single-author work by Prof. [Tao Yufei](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~taoyf/), awarded with PODS 2018 best paper. Prof. Tao gave us a seminar of his outstanding work on this Friday. In this seminar, he introduced (1) what the entity matching problem is; (2) how he formulates entity matching to a multidimensional classification problem; (3) his "small-and-sweet" algorithm to solve this problem and (4) some hints about his theoretical analysis. In this post, we focus on the first 3 points.

## The entity matching problem
Suppose Amazon and ebay place a set of advertisements on their website respectively, we denote this two sets with $A$ and $E$. each advertisement has attributes like *prod-name*, *prod-discription*, *year*, *price*, and so on. Now we want wo know whether advertisements $x$ and $y$ are about the same product, for all $(x, y) \in  A \times E$.

## Convert entity mathching to a multidimensional classification problem

## A "small-and-sweet" algorithm to solve the formulated problem


## My thoughts
