In this post, I exhibit some my preferred quotes or my own writings about life, study, research, etc.

## life
1. Better safe than sorry.
2. Better late than never.
3. 重剑无锋，大巧不工。
4. Stay hungry, stay foolish.
5. Stay simple, stay young. :)

## research
1. Think twice, code once.
2. Research means heuristic search, not exhaustive search.

To be continued...
